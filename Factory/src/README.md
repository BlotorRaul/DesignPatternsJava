# Factory Pattern
when a method treturn one of several possible classes that share a common super class

ex: create a new enemy in a game  


the class is chosen at run time

### When to ouse a factory pattern

When you don't know ahead of time what class object you need

When all of the potential classes are in the same subclass hierarchy

To centralize class selection code

When you don't want the user to have to know every subclass

To encapsulate object creation
